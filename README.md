## Overview

The Sort Simulator is a web application that visually demonstrates various sorting algorithms in action. It allows users to select an algorithm, adjust the data size and animation speed, and observe the sorting process in a step-by-step manner. 

## Features

*   **Algorithm Selection:** Choose from several popular sorting algorithms, including:
    *   Bubble Sort
    *   Selection Sort
    *   Insertion Sort
    *   Merge Sort
    *   Quick Sort
*   **Data Size Adjustment:** Control the number of elements to be sorted, allowing you to see how algorithms perform with different input sizes.
*   **Animation Speed Control:** Adjust the speed of the visualization to better understand the sorting process.
*   **Visual Representation:** Watch the algorithms sort a randomly generated array, with color-coded bars highlighting elements being compared or swapped.
*   **Reset Functionality:** Generate a new random array and reset the simulation at any time.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML:** Provides the structure and content of the web page.
*   **CSS:** Styles the web page and provides the visual presentation.
*   **Bootstrap:** A CSS framework used for responsive design and styling.
*   **JavaScript:** Implements the sorting algorithms, handles user interactions, and dynamically updates the visualization.
